To recreate the generated part of waverc manpage use a command like:
  help2man -N --output=waverc.1 --name='EtherWaver Keyboard/Mouse Client' /path/to/waverc

And for wavers:
  help2man -N --output=wavers.1 --name='EtherWaver Keyboard/Mouse Server' /path/to/wavers

After that manually fixup:
 * replace your home directory with $HOME in wavers.1
 * revert formatting of FILES and COPYRIGHT sections to match formatting of existing version.
 * add note referencing this file for instructions to the first line.
